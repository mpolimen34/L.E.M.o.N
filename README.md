## Description

Design and implement a system to measure food waste in Pierce Dining Hall on Stevens campus. The system would likely utilize a camera to identify types of food waste based on a database of variations of food. Some important variables to consider are the amount of food made initially, the amount of food waste after disposal (potentially determined through weight, density, etc.), and the amount of food taken from the serving line. These data values can be analyzed and compared to allow for eï¬ƒciency of food production in the future and minimization of waste.
